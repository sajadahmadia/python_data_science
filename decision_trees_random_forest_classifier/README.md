# Garment Workers' Productivity
The garment industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of the modern era. It is a highly labor-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies.

## Conclusion
While it is recommended to search for better-performing models, it is not always rewarded by finding a better one. Considering the accuracy score as our main objective in this project, our first model achieved a 78% score. Although we tested 40 random trees using Random forest classification in our second attempt and 72 other random trees(each one consisting of 50, 100, and 150 random trees) in our last attempt, we again reached the same accuracy metrics.
