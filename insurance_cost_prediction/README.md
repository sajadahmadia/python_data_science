# Predicting Insurance Costs
In this project, we'll be looking at the Medical Cost Data Set from Kaggle.
This dataset contains information on individual medical insurance bills.
Each bill is associated with some demographic and personal characteristics of the person who received it.

## The importance of this project: 
we want to construct the best possible predictive model for the cost, given some information about the patient.
Predicting medical costs is an important task because it allows hospitals to predict revenue and plan necessary procedures needed by their patient population.
